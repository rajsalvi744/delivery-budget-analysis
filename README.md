# Delivery Cost Budget Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This data analytics project investigates why delivery costs exceeded the planned budget. The analysis aims to identify key factors contributing to cost overruns and provide actionable insights for better cost management in future delivery operations.

## Problem Statement
The project addresses a critical business challenge where delivery costs have significantly exceeded budgeted amounts. Through detailed data analysis, we seek to:
- Identify the main drivers of cost overruns
- Quantify the impact of various factors on delivery costs
- Develop recommendations for cost optimization

## Project Structure
### 1. `data_files/`
This folder contains the input datasets required for the project. Each file is in csv format and includes the following:
- `payout.csv`: This sheet gives the actual and budget payout information of all the partners along with branch they work in, and cluster associated with the branch.
- `partner_vehicles_form_AMD.csv`: This sheet consolidates the form data acquired from the partners. Each row has information about one partner. It gives information about the vehicles operated by the partner: name of the vehicle, year of purchase, and type of purchase.
- `AMD_OU_Data.csv`: This sheet contains data related to the vehicles of partners such as capacity, mileage, maintenance cost,etc.
- `AMD_EMI_Data.csv`: This sheet contains data for calculating EMI of vehicles which a partner may incur. It contains downpayment % required, default tenure of EMI, yearly interest rate charged by banks, and ex-showroom price (in â‚¹) of all the vehicles.
- `vehicle_mapping.csv`: This sheet contains the mapping of vehicle codes and names.
- `payouts_table_AMD.csv`: This sheet gives the information on per kg rates and load delivered by partners responsible for delivering in pin codes covered by the Ahmedabad cluster.

### 2. `deliverables/`
This folder contains the processed output files generated by the project. Each file includes:
- `M1-overpay_analysis.xlsx`: As the name suggests this workbook contains the analysis done on the payouts to the partners.
- `M2-cost_structure.xlsx`: This workbook contains the cost incurred by the partners.
- `M3-profitability_analysis.xlsx`: In this workbook we calculate the profit/loss made by the partners.
- `M4_5-std_profitability_analysis.xlsx`: This workbook contains improvements done on the cost structure and profitability analysis done on that cost structure.
- `M6-commercials_calculator.xlsx`: This workbook contains a commercial calculator to calculate the price per/kg of partners based on the some inputs such as the vehicles owned by the partner, operating cluster, etc.

### 3. `Data Dictionary.pdf`
This PDF document provides detailed explanations of the table formats used in the files within the `data_files` folder. It includes:
- Column names and their meanings.
- Any additional metadata or constraints.

### 4. `README.md`
This file serves as the primary documentation for the project, offering an overview, directory structure, and usage instructions.

## Analysis Methodology
So we take a step by step approach to analyze the problem of overpayment to delivery partners (each step is refered as a milestone.).
In the first milestone we analyze the payment given to the delivery partners to find out the in which city/cluster the problem is severe. In this we aggregate data on cluster level.  \
In second milestone we try to find cost to run operation cost of the vehicles of the partners.  \
In third milestone we compare the operational cost to the total payout of the partners in **Ahmedabad** cluster to find out if the partners are making profits or losses if so, then how much.
In fourth milestone we try to improve(to reduce) the operational cost of the vehicles because even after out of budgets payouts the partners were making losses.
In fifth milestone we compare the improved cost structure to the payout.
In sixth milestone we create a commercials calculator to calculate the price per/kg of partners based on some inputs such as cluster, vehicles, additional cost,etc.


## Key Findings
- Out of 19 clusters/city that the partners deliver to 18 were overpaid. 
- **Ahmedabad** was the most overpaid cluster were almost twice the budgeted amount was paid and contributed for almost 16% of the total overpaid amount.
- **Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Mumbai, Coimbatore, Chennai** are responsible for almost 50% of the total overpayment amount.  
- Even though the partners were overpaid they were still incuring losses.Out of **48 partners** only **14** were making profits.
- After optimizing the cost structure of the partners out of 48 partners **16** were making profits while there was improvement it wasn't that effective.
- The reason for loss of the partners was more vehicles and under utitlization of vehicles which lead to high operational cost and low payout.Average utilization of the vehicles capacity was 25% of its total capacity.
- So to avoid overpayment to partners and to reduce the loss of the partners we will budget the delivery cost by calculating the price per/kg based on the partner's operational cost and its utilization.
